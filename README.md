# ReHoarder

> **Reorder your hoard. Then re-hoard.**
> An open-source desktop manager for your ever-growing pile of Unreal Engine assets.

ReHoarder is a cross-platform companion app for Unreal Engine creators who can't stop claiming every "Free for the Month" on Fab, every Epic vault giveaway, and every legacy Marketplace bundle — and then have no idea what they actually own.

It connects to your Epic Games account, indexes everything you've ever acquired across **Fab**, the **Epic Vault**, and the legacy **Unreal Engine Marketplace**, and gives you a single searchable, taggable, filterable library to make sense of it all.

---

## What it does

- **One library, three sources** — unifies Fab, the Epic Vault (UE5+), and the legacy Unreal Engine Marketplace into a single view.
- **Bulk metadata sync** — pulls titles, descriptions, screenshots, categories, supported engine versions, and pricing history for everything you own.
- **Local catalog** — keeps an offline cache so you can browse your library without an internet connection or sign-in round-trips.
- **Auto-claim Fab freebies** _(planned)_ — never miss a monthly free drop again.
- **Tagging and filtering** — organize by your own taxonomy: "used", "for current project", "wishlist", "never going to touch", etc.
- **Hide & exclude** — mark bloat, deprecated, or unwanted assets to keep them out of the active library view (bulk-download skip coming once bulk actions land).
- **Download manager** _(planned)_ — fetches asset manifests and installs them into a chosen UE project or a shared library folder.
- **Duplicate / overlap detection** _(planned)_ — flags assets you own multiple times across Humble Bundle, Fab, and the legacy Marketplace.

## Status

**Public alpha — under active development.** Star/watch the repo to follow along.

### What works today

- ✅ **Epic OAuth login** — `authorization_code` flow with refresh token, same scheme used by Legendary/Heroic.
- ✅ **Vault sync** — `/launcher/api/public/assets/Windows?label=Live` + parallel bulk catalog fetch (6 concurrent batches). Listing in the UI is hidden by default until Epic re-opens the download scope (`launcher:download:Live-Windows:<appName>`), which was removed for third-party clients in 2026.
- ✅ **Fab UE library sync** — `/e/accounts/{id}/ue/library`, paginated end-to-end on every sync (Fab orders by listing `createdAt`, not acquisition date, so freebies of months-old listings would slip past an incremental early-stop).
- ✅ **Fab entitlements** (acquisition date, owned licenses, last update): every sync also walks `/i/library/search?source=acquired&asset_formats=unreal-engine` next to the UE library and applies them to the matching assets. Unreal-only: non-UE listings are not indexed.
- ✅ **fab.com web session**: sign-in runs in a real (hidden) browser window in the persistent Cloudflare-warmed partition, silently when possible and through a visible "Sign in to Fab" window otherwise, and authenticated `/i/` calls run from inside the page. A chip next to Sync now shows the session state; it survives restarts.
- ✅ **Multi-source dedup** — assets that appear under both Epic Vault and Fab are reconciled via `legacyItemId` so the library shows a single card per asset.
- ✅ **Epic Chunked Manifest parser** (v0a) — full binary parser for Epic's `0x44BEC00C` format. Pure TypeScript, no new deps. 35 unit tests.
- ✅ **Fab manifest client** (v0b) — POST `/e/artifacts/{artifactId}/manifest`, CDN blob download with SHA1 verify across distribution points, hands off to the parser. 17 unit tests.
- ✅ **Chunk download + file assembly** (v0c) — fetch each `.chunk` from the CDN, verify Poly64 + SHA1, decompress (zlib), assemble files atomically on disk with file-level SHA1 verification. Chunks are fetched by a parallel read-ahead pool (Settings: Download threads, default 16) while files are assembled in order, inflated off the main thread, and cached on disk only when reused later in the download; files already complete are skipped up front and each download logs its throughput.
- ✅ **Downloads tab** (v0d) — per-asset Download button, persistent queue, live progress bars, per-version chip state in the asset grid (idle / queued / busy / error / downloaded / updatable). Finished asset packs and projects get an `Add to project` button next to `Open`.
- ✅ **Parallel downloads** — `maxConcurrentDownloads` (1–8) runs that many assets from the queue at once, each with its own progress bar and abort handle. Slot count is hot-reloadable from Settings.
- ✅ **Assets browser** — multi-token search across title + description + seller/creator (tokens can hit different fields, so `laya cry` surfaces `Crystal Cave` by `Laya Design`), source filter, listing-type filter, category filter, Engine version / Publisher / License / Added since filters with a Clear filters button, sorting by Newest / Oldest / Title / Last Updated (remembered across restarts), "only downloaded" / "only updatable" / "only bookmarked" toggles. Clicking a card's thumbnail opens its marketplace listing (hover zoom + pointer cursor); the seller / creator line under the title is a clickable link to a Fab search filtered by that creator. Bookmarks + per-card context menu (open on Fab, copy id, hide, …). Image-size picker, plus live grid zoom with `Ctrl` + wheel / `Ctrl` + `+` / `Ctrl` + `-` (`Ctrl` + `0` resets) — one step adds or removes exactly one column, and the choice is remembered across restarts.
- ✅ **Vault tab** — list of locally cached assets with friendly names, size, last-modified, sortable headers, optional thumbnails, delete-with-confirm (cascades to clear the chip on the Assets tab). Each row infers its payload kind from the `data/` layout: `project` (`data/*.uproject`, checked first), `asset` (`data/Content/…`), `plugin` (`data/Engine/Plugins/Marketplace/…`) or `unknown`, surfaced as a pill next to the name, plus a version pill with the engine version and Fab build (`UE 5.7 · build 48201490`). A per-asset `.rehoarder.json` sidecar persists the source / kind / engine metadata so hand-copied and orphaned assets keep their actions; folders with no metadata get their real name, source and thumbnail back by matching the folder name (the build's artifactId) against the synced library, and the engine version is inferred from the `.uproject` `EngineAssociation` or the `.uasset` header. Asset rows expose `Add to project`; project rows add `Create project`. Scan runs in parallel across asset dirs (libuv-pool-backed), warmed in the background at app startup, and auto-refreshes when a download finishes.
- ✅ **Projects tab** — recursive scan of configured project roots for `*.uproject`, descriptor metadata (engine association, description, category, code-vs-blueprint), Saved/AutoScreenshot thumbnail (with Fab thumbnail fallback for ReHoarder-created projects), open in Explorer, Launch editor (via `UnrealVersionSelector`), Run game with custom CLI params. Right-click Quick Actions: Fix redirectors (commandlet spawn with `-run=ResavePackages -fixupredirects -projectonly`), Delete binaries & caches (smart wipe preserving folder colors / collections / save games / project thumbnail), Deep clean (same wipe with a per-`Saved/` preserve modal — checkboxes for Editor preferences / Asset collections / Save games / Project thumbnail / Local packaged builds), and Create desktop shortcut.
- ✅ **Create project / Add to project** — copy a Fab project template into a new folder under a chosen parent, or merge an asset pack's `Content/` into an existing project (with skip/overwrite conflict mode). A version guard only allows a target project whose engine is the same as or newer than the asset (unknown versions are allowed with a warning). Add to project can also target any `/Game` subfolder or a plugin's content, optionally renaming the pack's folder: the pack is relocated headlessly inside a scratch project by the project's own engine (required engine plugins auto-enabled, Blueprints recompiled), so every reference, maps included, stays intact. Both dialogs can browse for a folder outside the configured roots, and they operate on the vault folder path so assets with no downloads row still work. Stamps a `.rehoarder.json` marker so the project is traceable back to its source asset.
- ✅ **Install from vault** — if the artifact is already in a vault path, plugin install into engine/project copies straight from disk without re-downloading. Path-prefix stripping handles the `Engine/Plugins/Marketplace/` indirection cleanly.
- ✅ **Custom install menu** — modal with searchbar, three-tier compatibility (requested-version exact match / older-version dimmed / incompatible hidden), "show N older projects" toggle, and engine-version disambiguation.
- ✅ **Engines tab** — scan for `UE_*/Engine/Build/Build.version`, per-row Launch button that spawns the editor directly (`UnrealEditor.exe` on UE5, `UE4Editor.exe` on UE4), branch-name cleanup (`++UE5+Release-5.5` → `UE5 Release 5.5`). Right-click context menu adds Set/Clear default engine (with a `Default` badge in the row), Create desktop shortcut (`.lnk` written via wscript-driven VBS), and Uninstall engine (rm tree + HKCU de-registration + `enginePaths` prune, behind a confirm modal). **Register with Epic Launcher** adds the engine to `LauncherInstalled.dat` (the list Unreal's Version Selector and the `.uproject` association read, backup kept) without downloading anything, and **Rename registration…** gives a source build registered under `HKCU\…\Builds` a readable name in place of its GUID, retargeting the `EngineAssociation` of the projects that used it.
- ✅ **Install engine from Epic library** — `Install engine…` picker on the Engines tab lists owned-but-not-installed UE versions (dedup by `major.minor` against the local scan), components dialog (Core / Templates / Engine Source / MetaHuman / Editor Symbols / Target Platforms with live dependency propagation and selection-size footer), queue through the existing parallel chunk downloader, UAC pre-flight + relaunch flow for protected install paths, post-install bookkeeping that appends to `enginePaths` and registers the engine under `HKCU\…\Builds\{GUID}` so the OS `.uproject` association works. Owned-engines list is persisted to disk with a user-configurable TTL (Settings → Downloads → Owned engines cache, default 7 days) plus a background refresh on launch so reopening the picker after a restart is instant.
- ✅ **Engine plugins toggler** — scans `<engine>/Engine/Plugins/` for `.uplugin` descriptors (JSON5-tolerant), surfaces `EnabledByDefault` / `Installed` flags with the plugin icon, writes flag changes back preserving original formatting (`.bak` safety net). Searchbar + All/Enabled/Installed/Modified filters, batched Apply, per-engine baseline snapshot with one-click "Restore baseline" rollback. Baseline divergence is surfaced in a hover popover next to the Restore button — engine plugins on top, marketplace plugins (governed by a synthetic `off / installed=true` policy with a RiderLink exception) in a trailing section, each line showing the target `EnabledByDefault` / `Installed` value in green/red so the user knows exactly what Restore would do without opening the dialog.
- ✅ **Plugin preset templates** — JSON preset (`{ plugins: [{ name, enabledByDefault, installed, fromUser? }] }`) with one global fallback + per-engine overrides. Right-click on a plugin row → Open plugin folder / Install in project (copied into `<project>/Plugins/<PluginName>`, created when missing, named after the `.uplugin` instead of the engine's build-id folder) / Open documentation (`DocsURL`) / Open Fab page (`MarketplaceURL`, old Marketplace ids fall back to a Fab search) / Add to config / Remove from config / Uninstall plugin (Marketplace folder only, behind a confirm). Apply-to-all gated by a confirm modal naming the engine count. Entries that the user added or modified via "Add to config" carry a `fromUser: true` flag — they survive template re-apply verbatim while the rest of the file is overwritten with fresh template state, so the user's overrides aren't blown away by upstream template updates.
- ✅ **Engine editor-settings master patcher** — applies a curated `BaseEditorPerProjectUserSettings.ini` to every engine's config (sentinel header, scalar/array-add/`CommentAll` merge, `.bak` on first apply, side-by-side LCS diff preview + Restore from baseline on right-click).
- ✅ **Engine keybindings master patcher** — same flow against the per-user `EditorKeyBindings.ini` (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\UnrealEngine\<ver>\…`), dedup-by-version when applying to all (multiple installs of one engine version share the file).
- ✅ **Bundled preset library** — `resources/presets/{plugins,keybindings,editor-settings}/` (shipped via `electron-builder.yml` `extraResources`) ships an `example` annotated starter plus a curated `ares-recommended` set: 16 plugin entries (Source Code Access cleanup, Apple/SpeedTree disabled, BlueprintAssist + 5 marketplace tools enabled), 92 keybinding entries covering BlueprintAssist cleanups, personal LevelBlueprint / Stop-PIE shortcuts and a full Italian-keyboard alt-chord remap layer (E_AccentGrave / + / ò / ù as ChordIndex 1 secondaries on every Epic command that uses `LeftBracket` / `RightBracket` / `SemiColon` / `Backslash`), and an editor-settings master with monitor presets, Live Coding disabled and Blueprint editor tuning. Applied files are stamped with `; @source` / `; @applied` (INI) and `_source` / `_applied` (JSON) provenance markers, persisted across user edits — they unlock future "reapply latest" / drift-detection flows. User files land at `ReHoarderEditorKeyBindings.ini` / `ReHoarderEditorSettings.ini` / `ReHoarderPluginConfig.json` in `userData` (renamed from the older `-master`/`plugin-preset` names for provenance clarity).
- ✅ **Set-as-template flow** — copy a project into `<Engine>/Templates/<TP_Name>/`, generate `Config/TemplateDefs.ini`, reuse `Saved/AutoScreenshot.png` as the launcher icon. Blueprint-only projects suggest `TP_<Name>BP` so Unreal pairs them with the C++ template variant.
- ✅ **Fab Giveaway tab** — monthly freebies from Fab's `free_content_blade` endpoint, with a per-card Claim-on-Fab deep link and a per-card `Mark as claimed` toggle (plus `Mark all as claimed`), stored per account. Claimed state is manual: marking clears the tab badge and the optional non-blocking startup toast (`notifyAboutUnclaimedFreebiesOnStartup`). A per-account weekly probe re-shows the notification only when the free set actually changes (new UID batch), with no background library sync.
- ✅ **Multi-account switcher** — keep multiple Epic accounts authenticated at the same time and toggle between them from the top-bar chip. Per-account scoping for `assets`, `asset_tags`, `sync_state`, `downloads`; per-account encrypted tokens (`auth.tokens.<accountId>`); per-account renderer stores reload on switch. The CF-warmup partition cookies are flushed on switch so the fab.com web session can't carry over the previous identity. Engine installs are stamped with a synthetic `__engine__` account id so they remain visible regardless of which user is active.
- ✅ **Cruft filter at download** — glob-based skip list (defaults + user extras), per-asset "Clean cruft" action in the Vault tab with scan-preview dialog.
- ✅ **uproject editor** — JSON editor panel with atomic write + `.uproject.bak` backup; reads & writes `EngineAssociation`, `Description`, `Category`, `Modules`, `Plugins`, `AdditionalDependencies` etc.
- ✅ **Settings panel** — project / engine / vault paths (the vault defaults to the Epic Games Launcher's `VaultCache`, and missing vault folders are created), image size (in Downloads), downloads pane (threads, compile plugins on install, skip non-current-platform binaries, skip cruft at download + extra glob patterns), Engines pane with the three master fields (plugin preset, editor settings, keybindings), per-tab "separate by path" and "show thumbnails" toggles, `Ctrl+S` save shortcut. The Save button lives in a sticky header with an explicit "Unsaved changes" cue, and saving a changed path list rescans the tab that scans it (Projects / Engines / Vault) in the background.
- ✅ **On-disk thumbnails** — Projects show their `Saved/AutoScreenshot.png` (with Fab thumbnail fallback for ReHoarder-created projects), Engines show their splash icon, Vault rows can show their cached image. Served through a custom restricted `rh-file://` scheme so the renderer CSP stays tight; allow-list of roots = configured project / engine / vault paths.
- ✅ **Singleton renderer stores** — Vault, Projects, Engines and Downloads each live in a single Svelte store at module scope, so tab switches are free (no rescan unless the user asks for one).
- ✅ **SQLite catalog** — assets, tags, sync_state, downloads, bookmarks. Schema migrations via `PRAGMA user_version` for one-shot fixes (category re-tagging, listing-type backfill, …).
- ✅ **Velopack installer + in-app auto-update** — Windows installer, delta updates, `Settings → Startup & behavior` pane that checks GitHub Releases for the latest `vX.Y.Z` and applies it on next restart. Startup auto-check is now actually wired, and an optional `autoDownloadAndInstallUpdates` flag silently installs + restarts when a newer build is found at launch (with a native Windows toast announcing the restart so the silent quit doesn't look like a crash). No update server required.

### What's next

- 📋 **Style / Technical features filters** (fab.com tags such as Stylized, Rigged, Nanite): tags are only a server-side filter on `/i/library/search`, so they need a per-tag sync pass.
- 📋 **Source-build engines detection** — installing an engine through ReHoarder writes the `HKCU\…\Builds\{GUID}` entry already, but user-built engines registered outside ReHoarder are not yet surfaced in the Projects tab when an `.uproject` references them by GUID.
- 📋 **Mid-download engine manifest refresh** — Epic's signed CDN URLs are good for ~60 min; on slow internet a 100+ GB engine download may outlive its signatures and start 403-ing. Cancel + re-enqueue works today (it re-fetches and resumes from the persisted chunk cache), but seamless refresh-without-cancel is a follow-up.
- 📋 **Auto-claim Fab freebies** — the Freebies tab surfaces them today, but claiming still requires opening Fab in the browser.
- 📋 **Auto-update detection on assets** — flag library assets when their server-side `modifiedDate` changes (the data is already in the catalog).
- 📋 **Linux/macOS pass** — the download pipeline is platform-agnostic but plugin-compile and engine-launch flows still assume Windows path conventions in spots.

## Why another asset manager?

ReHoarder aims to be:

- **Fully open source** (MIT) — readable, auditable, forkable.
- **Cross-platform first-class** — Linux, Windows, and macOS treated as equals from day one.
- **Privacy-respectful** — your account credentials and library data stay on your machine.

## Platforms

- Windows 10/11
- Linux (any modern distro)
- macOS _(planned)_

## Tech stack

- **Electron** + **TypeScript** for the desktop shell and OAuth-via-embedded-browser flow.
- **Svelte 5** (runes) for the renderer UI.
- **SQLite** for the local library catalog.

### Release with Velopack (Windows)

ReHoarder uses [Velopack](https://velopack.io) for installers + in-app auto-update. The flow is:

1. `electron-vite build` produces the JS bundles.
2. `electron-builder --dir --win` packs them into a real `ReHoarder.exe` under `release/win-unpacked/`.
3. `vpk pack` reads that directory and emits `Releases/ReHoarder-Setup.exe` plus the delta-package + `RELEASES` index that the in-app updater consumes.
4. `vpk upload github` attaches all of the above to a GitHub Release matching `vX.Y.Z`.

**Local prerequisites:**

```bash
# Once per machine — vpk is a dotnet 8 global tool
dotnet tool install -g vpk
```

**Cut a release locally:**

```bash
# 1. Bump version in package.json (e.g. 0.1.0)
# 2. Build + pack
npm run build:win
# Outputs land under ./Releases/ — verify by running ReHoarder-Setup.exe in a VM.
# 3. Upload to GitHub (needs $env:GITHUB_TOKEN with `repo` scope)
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_..."
npm run release:win
```

**Cut a release from CI:**

Push a tag — `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on `v*` tags. The workflow installs `vpk`, runs `build:win` and `release:win` using the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`. No secret setup required.

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

In-app updates: the `Settings → About & updates` pane uses Velopack's `UpdateManager` to check `github.com/Ares9323/ReHoarder` for the latest release, downloads the delta when available, and applies it on the next restart. No update server / S3 bucket required.

### Dev exe rebrand (Windows)

By default `npm run dev` launches Electron's bundled `electron.exe`, so Windows' Task Manager shows the helper processes as "Electron". The `predev` hook runs `scripts/brand-dev-electron.cjs`, which uses [`rcedit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rcedit) to rewrite the Win32 version-info on the local `node_modules/electron/dist/electron.exe` so it shows up as "ReHoarder" instead. The script is idempotent (stamps a `.rehoarder-branded` marker next to the exe) and re-runs automatically whenever `npm install` replaces the binary. It's a no-op on Linux/macOS; on Windows you only need to make sure `npm install` has been run after the `rcedit` devDep was added.

For packaged builds (`npm run build:win` / `:linux` / `:mac`) the rebrand is unnecessary — `electron-builder.yml`'s `productName: ReHoarder` already names the distributed binary correctly.

### Debug commands (DevTools console)

The app exposes a `window.api.debug` namespace for testing internals while the UI for downloads is still in progress. Open ReHoarder, hit `Ctrl+Shift+I`, switch to the Console tab.

```js
// List the first 5 assets from a source (helpful to grab an assetId)
const list = await window.api.library.list({ source: 'fab' })
list.assets.slice(0, 5).map(a => ({ id: a.sourceId, title: a.title }))

// End-to-end test of the parser + manifest client against the real Fab CDN.
// Fetches /e/artifacts/{artifactId}/manifest, downloads the binary blob with
// SHA1 verify, parses it, and dumps both the raw blob and the parsed JSON to
// %APPDATA%/ReHoarder/debug/ on Windows (or the equivalent userData dir).
await window.api.debug.fetchSampleManifest('<assetId>')
// → { ok, fileCount, chunkCount, totalFileSize, baseUris, savedBlobPath, savedJsonPath, ... }

// Full end-to-end download of a real asset into
// <userData>/debug-downloads/<artifactId>/data/. Fetches the manifest,
// downloads every chunk from the CDN, verifies Poly64 + SHA1 on each
// chunk and on every assembled file, writes the files atomically. Pick a
// SMALL asset first (under ~50 MB) for the initial test.
await window.api.debug.downloadSampleAsset('<assetId>')
// → { ok, fileCount, bytesWritten, durationMs, dataDir, firstFiles, ... }

// Wipe the local library + sync_state so the next sync runs as a full sync.
// Useful when re-testing the sync pipeline end-to-end.
await window.api.debug.clearLibrary()
// → { ok, assetsRemoved, tagsRemoved, syncStateRowsReset }

// Wipe only one source (e.g. just Fab) — Vault stays intact.
await window.api.debug.clearLibrary({ sources: ['fab'] })

// Kick off a sync programmatically (same as pressing "Sync now" in the UI).
await window.api.library.sync()
```

These IPCs are dev-only and will be removed (or gated behind a setting) before the first stable release.
